# local_RAG Tasklist

**Local implementation of a minimalistic RAG application with its web interface**

This document outlines the project roadmap for `local_RAG` in a clear, structured manner. It details the tasks and phases for the development, testing, and deployment of the application, which utilizes Docker Compose, the Ollama project, and a Python:Alpine container running Django.

---

## 1. Project Initialization

### Repository Setup
- [x] Create a new Git repository named `local_RAG`.
- [x] Write a clear `README.md` with project overview, scope, and initial setup instructions.
- [x] Establish a `.gitignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., Python cache, Docker artifacts).

### Directory Structure
- Define clear folders for each component:
  - `/api` – Configuration and scripts for the Ollama container.
  - `/web` – Django project files and Python container-related code.
  - `/docs` – Project documentation and technical specs.
  - `/configs` – Docker Compose files, environment variables, and configuration files.

---

## 2. Requirements & Planning

### Define Functional Requirements
- Document the API endpoints for the Ollama service.
- Outline the RAG pipeline: document ingestion, embedding conversion, vector storage (ChromaDB), and LLM processing.
- Detail the user flow for the web interface, from prompt submission to result display.

### Define Technical Requirements
- List dependencies:
  - Docker & Docker Compose.
  - Ollama Docker image.
  - Python:Alpine with Django, `requests`, and the Ollama Python API package.
- Establish performance, logging, and error handling expectations.

---

## 3. Docker & Environment Setup

### Docker Compose Configuration
- Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate the multi-container setup.
- Define two services:
  - **Ollama Service:** 
    - Use the official Ollama project Docker image.
    - Expose API endpoints for embedding conversion and LLM processing.
    - Configure ChromaDB within this container.
  - **Web Service:**
    - Use a Python:Alpine image.
    - Set up environment variables for Django, API endpoints, and network communication.
- Map appropriate ports and set up inter-container networking.

### Container Environment Files
- Create environment variable files (e.g., `.env`) for both containers.
- Include secrets, configuration keys, and dependency versions.

---

## 4. Ollama Container Setup

### API and Service Configuration
- Configure the container to expose RESTful API endpoints.
- Set up document embedding functionality using support documents.
- Integrate ChromaDB to store and manage embeddings.
- Enable LLM processing within the container for prompt-based inference.

### Testing and Debugging
- Develop simple test scripts or endpoints to verify the functionality of the Ollama container.
- Ensure proper logging for troubleshooting API calls.

---

## 5. Web Interface Development (Python:Alpine Container)

### Django Project Initialization
- Create a new Django project within the `/web` directory.
- Set up Django apps, focusing on API integration and user interface.

### Integration of Ollama API
- Install and configure the Ollama Python API package.
- Develop Django views to:
  - Accept user prompts.
  - Forward requests to the Ollama container.
  - Process and display responses.
- Build Django forms and templates for user interactions.

### Communication & Error Handling
- Implement robust error handling for API calls using `requests`.
- Log interactions and errors for monitoring.

---

## 6. Integration & Communication

### Inter-Container Communication
- Validate network connectivity between the Ollama and web containers via Docker Compose.
- Test API calls from the Django app to the Ollama endpoints.
- Ensure that response times and error messages are properly handled.

### Security Considerations
- Secure API endpoints with proper authentication if necessary.
- Ensure environment variables and secrets are not exposed.

---

## 7. Testing & Quality Assurance

### Unit & Integration Testing
- Write unit tests for individual components (Django views, API endpoints).
- Develop integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality of the RAG pipeline.

### Performance Testing
- Validate the responsiveness of the embedding generation, vector retrieval, and LLM processing.
- Optimize Docker configurations if needed.

### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- Set up a staging environment to gather feedback from initial users.
- Iterate based on user input and performance metrics.

---

## 8. Documentation & Deployment

### Comprehensive Documentation
- Update the `README.md` with detailed setup instructions, usage guidelines, and troubleshooting tips.
- Create technical documentation covering:
  - Docker Compose configuration.
  - API endpoints and expected inputs/outputs.
  - Detailed overview of the RAG pipeline and its components.

### Deployment Strategy
- Prepare production-ready Docker configurations.
- Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate testing and deployment.
- Plan for scaling, monitoring, and logging in a production environment.

---

## 9. Maintenance & Future Enhancements

### Ongoing Support
- Monitor system performance and user feedback.
- Set up automated alerts for any system failures or performance issues.

### Enhancements Roadmap
- Identify areas for future improvements (e.g., more robust security, additional API features, enhanced UI/UX).
- Maintain version control and detailed changelogs for continuous improvement.
